        <h2>Short Bio</h2>
        <p>Dr. Avi Sil is a Senior Director of Applied Science at Oracle AI. His teams work on various technologies on Agentic workflows for Deep Research, alignment of reasoning LLMs via reinforcement learning and inference scaling with LLMs. Previously, he spent over a decade at IBM Research (New York) as a people manager, leading strategy for Agentic workflows and their integration into products like code assistants and AI agentic middleware. He has pioneered several initiatives at IBM, including rebuilding the company's leadership in Question Answering and spearheading the development of Agent 101, IBM Research's first AI agent, which topped the SWE-Bench leaderboard. </p>
        <p> With over a decade of experience, Avi is internationally recognized for his contributions to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic Workflows involving large language models. His research also covers inference-scaling algorithms, uncertainty in LLMs, reinforcement learning-based verifiers, and natural language to code (Spec2Generation).</p>
        <p>Avi has also held dual positions at Stanford University as a Visiting Research Scholar since 2021 till 2025 as part of the IBM-Stanford collaboration. He has been the main point of contact for the <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/industry" target="IBM Stanford HAI affliation">IBM Stanford HAI affliation</a> (with <a href="https://stanford.edu/~cgpotts/" target="Chris Potts">Chris Potts, a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~matei/" target="Matei Zaharia">Matei Zaharia</a> and <a href="https://omarkhattab.com/" target="Omar Khattab">Omar Khattab</a>) and also for the recent SEAMS collaboration (with Azalia Mirhoseini, Chris Re and Percy Liang). In the past he has collaborated with CMU (<a href="https://www.phontron.com/" target="Graham Neubig">Graham Neubig</a>), Stony Brook (<a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~niranjan/" target="Niranjan Balasubramanian">Niranjan Balasubramanian</a>), UMass (Mohit Iyyer) and UIUC NLP (Heng Ji).</p>
        <p>
        He actively contributes to the NLP community, serving in senior roles (SAC, track chair) at major conferences like ACL and NAACL, and holds over 20 U.S. patents in AI technologies.</p>
